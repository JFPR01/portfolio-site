	<p> I am a recent Electrical Engineering graduate from the University of Houston with experience in FPGA programming, embedded systems, and digital 
	electronics. My background includes developing automated testing solutions at Baker Hughes using Python and the Typhoon HIL platform, as well as 
	designing robotic and interactive systems with a focus on reliability and integration. I am currently preparing to take the FE Electrical and 
	Computer exam in December 2025 and seek opportunities to apply and expand my technical knowledge in a professional engineering environment. </p>

	<p style="font-weight: bold;">I am a U.S. green card holder and authorized to work without sponsorship. </p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Experience</h2>
            <p><strong>Baker Hughes</strong> - Engineering Technology Intern (Jun 2024 – Aug 2024)</p>
	    <p> During my internship at Baker Hughes I developed and implemented an automated test script using Python and 
the Typhoon HIL platform for the Advantage Variable Speed Drive (VSD) system. The VSD specifically operated as a 6 pulse system. This project replaced a manual testing process that previously took 
8 hours with a fully automated workflow that completed the same series of operations in just 30 minutes, a 94% reduction in test time. I programmed
 the system to execute and evaluate 120 distinct test cases, ranging from 120% voltage surges to 0% sags of varying durations, and designed it to 
generate categorized results with waveform data for post-analysis.</p>

	    <p>The tool not only accelerated development cycles but also increased consistency and reliability by removing human error from repetitive 
testing procedures. My work provided a reusable framework for future automation within the department, with potential scalability for 12 and 
24 pulse VSD systems. This experience taught me how to apply automation and control principles to enhance efficiency, precision, and repeatability 
— delivering measurable value to a large-scale engineering operation.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">University Projects</h2>
            <p><strong>Humanoid Robot</strong> (Aug 2024 - May 2025)</p>
	    <p>I worked with a team comprised of 4 other peers to design and implement the torso of a humanoid robot, which served as the main structural
 and functional hub for all other subsystems. The torso was designed as part of a larger humanoid robot for use by the University of Houston's BRAIN center.
 The torso housed the primary power system and provided the main connection point for extremities, enabling 
seamless communication with the robot’s control system. I integrated CAN bus protocol and EtherCAT communication protocols with a Raspberry Pi 4, allowing precise
 control of brushless motors and enabling the robot to achieve two degrees of motion. This project strengthened my understanding of real-time communication,
 distributed control, and system integration in robotics applications.</p>

            <p><strong>FPGA Memory Game</strong> (Jan 2025 - May 2025)</p>

	    <p> For my digital design coursework, my team and myself developed a Verilog-based Random Sequence Recall Game on the DE0-CV FPGA board. The 
system incorporated a secure multi-user login with ROM-based ID and password verification, as well as modular components for difficulty selection, random 
sequence generation, and performance tracking. Real-time feedback was displayed through LEDs, providing an engaging user interface that demonstrated principles of digital logic, memory control, and user-system interaction. This project gave me practical experience in hardware description language design, modular coding practices, and embedded interface implementation.

            <p><strong>Diode Thermometer</strong> (Jan 2023 - May 2023)</p>

	    <p> In this project, I was part of a team that designed and built a temperature measurement system using diodes, resistors, BJTs, and an 
Arduino. By leveraging the thermal voltage characteristics of diodes, the circuit could detect small changes in temperature and output corresponding 
voltage readings. I programmed the Arduino to convert these readings into temperature values, achieving fast and reliable detection of temperature 
fluctuations. This project helped me connect semiconductor physics to practical analog applications and improved my understanding of sensor calibration 
and circuit behavior.</p>

            <p> <strong>Active Member of SHPE</strong> (2021-2025)</p>

   	    <p> As an active member of SHPE, I participated in professional workshops, general meetings, and networking events that expanded my 
exposure to industry practices and leadership opportunities. Through these experiences, I developed strong communication, collaboration, and 
problem-solving skills while engaging with fellow engineers and industry mentors. SHPE played a key role in shaping my professional identity 
and in encouraging continuous growth as both a student and an engineer. </p>

        <section id="community">
            <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Community Service</h2>

            <p> Outside of academics, I have contributed over 120 hours of community service through Camps International and Special Olympics in Ecuador. 
These experiences included supporting athletes with disabilities, participating in environmental initiatives, and collaborating in multicultural team 
environments. These experiences not only deepened my appreciation for global teamwork and inclusivity but also reinforced the importance of service, 
adaptability, and compassion in both personal and professional contexts.</p>
